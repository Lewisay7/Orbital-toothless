Why TrackUrCal:
Young gens nowadays are concerned about their health. They adapt a healthier lifestyle that is highly correlated with exercise and diet. These two critical components of a healthy lifestyle point towards an ultimate metric: CALORIES.

A personâ€™s net calorie intake provides a picture of one's lifestyle sustainability. It is essential for an individual to keep track of his/her lifestyle. However, calculating the calories for actions we did daily is really not that easy.

This led us to think: Wouldn't it be better if an application did all the tedious work for us?
